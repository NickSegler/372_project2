Shape Library

1. Creating shapes
  There are several different shapes that can be created using this library
    ● Circle
        circles are created using the Circle class
          Circle(double radius)

    ● Rectangle
        rectangles are created using the Rectangle class
          Rectangle(double Width, double Height)

    ● Regular Polygons
        regular polygons are created using the Polygon class (including squares and triangles)
          Polygon(double Side length, int Number of sides)
                              or
          Polygon(double Width, double Height, int Number of sides)
              - Width and Height should be the same size as the bounding box

        Square: a polygon of 4 sides

        Equilateral triangle: a 3 sided polygon

2. Modifying shapes
  Rotating a shape
    R_shape(B_shape * Rotate This, double Angle)
      Rotate This needs to be a shape derived from a B_shape class

      Angle is the degrees to rotate by

  Scaling a shape
    S_shape(B_shape * Scale This, double Scale X, double Scale Y)


3. Drawing shapes
  Drawing is simple using this library
    the Draw function can be used the same way for all shapes

    Draw(pair<double,double> Coords, bool To file)
        using make_pair from #include<utility> is the best way to pass Coords
        if To file is true the postscript code is saved to a file
        the postscript code is also returned as a string for you to use as needed
