Shape Library

1. Creating shapes
  There are several different shapes that can be created using this library
    ● Circle
        circle is not yet implemented

    ● Rectangle
        rectangles are created using the Rectangle class
          Rectangle(double Width, double Height)

    ● Regular Polygons
        regular polygons are created using the Polygon class
          Polygon(double Side length, int Number of sides)
                              or
          Polygon(double Width, double Height, int Number of sides)
              - Width and Height should be the same size as the bounding box
